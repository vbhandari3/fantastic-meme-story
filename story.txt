	It all started when Jerry had to take care of his 12-year-old sister, Angela, since their parents 
went out of town for the weekend. It was a bright, sunny day, while Jerry and Angela were watching 
Spongebob. Out the blue, a pigeon entered into the house from the open window. 
  
Angela was starttled by the bird, yelling for Jerry's help. Jerry was reluctant to help Angela, because he
was forced to watch her for the weekend. He laughed at her panick, deep down it felt like revenge for making
 him miss a movie date with friends. Once he got his fill, he got up to help when suddenly the bird spoke.

"Hello! I am a messenger bird sent from Hogwarts school of magic! I am here to deliver your invitation to attend
our school this coming semester." Jerry couldn't believe his eyes. Could Hogwarts be a real place? Was Harry Potter 
a real person? Before he could ask any questions, the bird dropped the invitation into Angela's hands and flew back
out the window. Confused but intrigued, there was only one thing for Angela and Jerry to do... follow the instructions on
the invitation.
