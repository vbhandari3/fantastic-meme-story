	It all started when Jerry had to take care of his 12-year-old sister, Angela, since their parents 
went out of town for the weekend. It was a bright, sunny day, while Jerry and Angela were watching 
Spongebob. Out the blue, a pigeon entered into the house from the open window. 
  
Angela was starttled by the bird, yelling for Jerry's help. Jerry was reluctant to help Angela, because he
was forced to watch her for the weekend. He laughed at her panick, deep down it felt like revenge for making
 him miss a movie date with friends. Once he got his fill, he got up to help when suddenly the bird spoke.
